Nowadays, there are quite a few non-profit organizations that aim to help the needy in 
diverse fields. In order for aid organizations to be able to operate and even expand the 
scope of their activities, they need volunteers who will be involved in the process. Some 
of the existing associations are not recognized enough among the residents and therefore 
have difficulty recruiting volunteers. In addition, there are many residents who are 
interested in contributing to the community and volunteering but do not know who to 
contact or don't know a volunteer place that suits their ability and desire where they can 
contribute in the best way.
In our project, we developed a social app that focuses on volunteering in the cities of Be'er 
Sheva and Ofakim in order to effectively manage the array of volunteers and increase the 
number of volunteers. The app is a platform for advertising and exposing the activities of 
the organizations and will communicate between the residents who are interested in 
volunteering and the volunteer organizations and the needy through the volunteer director 
in the city.
The app has additional options such as: uploading items for delivery, time-dependent 
volunteering and volunteering with the elderly and people with disabilities that require 
access.
The app has two types of users: volunteer and volunteer manager. 
A volunteer can register and log-in, view all existing volunteer organizations in his city 
by categories, apply to volunteer in the organization of his choice, upload an item for 
delivery and more.
A volunteer manager can log-in to the app and make real-time updates related to 
organizations and volunteers.
The application provides a convenient and user-friendly interface, is designed for iOS and 
Android operating systems, and was developed in React Native in a Visual Studio Code 
work environment, JavaScript language and Firebase database.
